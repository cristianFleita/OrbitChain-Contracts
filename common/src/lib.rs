//! Common types shared across the OrbitChain workspace.
//!
//! This crate provides canonical definitions for `CampaignStatus`, `MilestoneStatus`,
//! and `AssetInfo` used by both campaign and core contracts.
//!
//! This crate intentionally does **not** define a `#[contracterror]` enum.
//! Contract-specific crates own their typed error spaces so shared data types
//! cannot accidentally collide with stable on-chain error discriminants.
//! Campaign errors live in `orbitchain-campaign::types::Error`; the deprecated
//! reference core contract keeps its separate `CoreError` until it is retired.

#![no_std]
// Re-link `std` only under `cargo test` so the `#[cfg(test)]` modules in
// `version::tests` (and any future sibling) can use `Vec`, `format!`,
// `assert!`, etc. Per no_std crate convention the `extern crate std;`
// must live at the crate root to re-establish the std crate's
// presence in the test target, since `#![no_std]` excludes it from the
// normal prelude.
#[cfg(test)]
